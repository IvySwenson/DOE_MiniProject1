# üî• Alaska Wildfire Data Analysis

## üìò Overview

This Jupyter Notebook explores wildfire data from Alaska, focusing on the **relationship between environmental predictors and fire behavior variables**.
The goal is to understand what factors most strongly influence wildfire spread and to prepare for future predictive modeling.

---

## üß© Objectives

1. **Separate variables** into output (fire behavior) and input (predictors).
2. **Clean and preprocess** the dataset by handling missing values and removing redundant features.
3. **Perform correlation analysis** between predictors and target variables.
4. **Visualize trends** across different geographic and environmental conditions.
5. **Develop hypotheses** for more complex research questions and future ML modeling.

---

## üóÇ Dataset Description

The dataset contains Alaska wildfire records with variables such as:

* **Output (Fire Behavior Variables):**
  `ESTIMATEDTOTALACRES`, `ACTUALTOTALACRES`, `PRESCRIBEDFIRE`, `DISCOVERYSIZE`, `IASIZE`
* **Predictors (Input Variables):**
  `GENERALCAUSE`, `SPECIFICCAUSE`, `PRIMARYFUELTYPE`, `SLOPE`, `ELEVATION`, `LATITUDE`, `LONGITUDE`, `ASPECT`, and temporal attributes (e.g., `YEAR`, `DATE`).

---

## üßº Data Preprocessing

The notebook performs several cleaning and preparation steps:

* **Handling Missing Values:** Columns with too many null values are dropped.
* **Feature Separation:** Input and output variables are organized in separate frames for clarity.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Highly correlated variables are identified and one of each redundant pair is removed.
* **Encoding:** Categorical variables (e.g., `GENERALCAUSE`, `PRIMARYFUELTYPE`) are encoded as numeric features when necessary.
* **Outlier Check:** Optional visualization (boxplots/scatter) helps identify unusual values.

---

## üìä Exploratory & Correlation Analysis

The notebook includes multiple research questions:

1. Is there a correlation between `ESTIMATEDTOTALACRES` and `GENERALCAUSE` / `SPECIFICCAUSE`?
2. Is there a correlation between `ESTIMATEDTOTALACRES` and `SLOPE`?
3. How does `PRIMARYFUELTYPE` affect fire size (`ESTIMATEDTOTALACRES`)?
4. Are any predictor variables strongly correlated with each other?

### Methods & Tools

* **Pandas:** data loading, cleaning, and correlation (`.corr()`).
* **NumPy:** numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** visualizing relationships through heatmaps, boxplots, and scatter plots.
* **Statistical Tests:** Pearson/Spearman correlation to measure linear/nonlinear associations.

---

## üîç Advanced Analyses

Later sections of the notebook explore more complex questions:

* Identifying the **strongest predictors in different Alaska regions**, divided by latitude/longitude.
* Analyzing **temporal trends** ‚Äî e.g., whether major `PRIMARYFUELTYPE` categories changed over the past decade.
* Evaluating whether combinations of predictors (e.g., `SLOPE + PRIMARYFUELTYPE`) improve correlation with fire size.

---

## üñº Visualizations

The notebook produces a range of visual outputs:

* Correlation heatmaps
* Scatter plots (e.g., `ESTIMATEDTOTALACRES` vs `SLOPE`)
* Boxplots grouped by categorical causes or fuel types
* Temporal trend charts by year or location

All figures help illustrate key relationships in the Alaska wildfire dataset.

---

## üß† Key Findings (Example)

* Certain **fuel types** are strongly associated with larger estimated burn areas.
* **Slope and elevation** show moderate correlation with total acres burned.
* Several **predictor variables** (e.g., `ASPECT` and `SLOPE`) are highly correlated ‚Äî useful for dimensionality reduction.
* Geographic and temporal trends may indicate shifting fire patterns over time.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment & Requirements

This analysis runs entirely in **Jupyter Notebook**.
You can reproduce it with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
jupyter notebook
```

Then open:

```
AK_Fire_Analysis.ipynb
```

---

## üöÄ Future Work

* Extend analysis using **machine learning models** (linear regression, decision trees) to predict fire size.
* Conduct **causality studies** to distinguish correlation from actual influence.
* Visualize results with **interactive dashboards** (Plotly, Streamlit).

---

## ‚ú® Author & Context

This notebook was developed as part of an Alaska wildfire data research exercise.
It combines **data cleaning**, **statistical exploration**, and **visualization** to prepare for future predictive modeling of wildfire behavior.
